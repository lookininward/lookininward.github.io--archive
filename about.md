		<p>My introduction to programming began during time as a real estate developer’s admin. Leaning on some previous knowledge of Microsoft Excel I transitioned into an analyst role, building reports that analyzed project plans. There I moved from simple formulas, to macros, and VBA scripting. I learned to automate processes, and became more productive too. When the company sites had to be updated, I took over for the original developer and got exposed to more html, css, and frameworks like bootstrap. Basic JavaScript and jQuery followed, along with concepts like responsive design, and search engine and web optimization.</p>

		<p>After some time spent working, I entered a graduate program at UofT’s Faculty of Information, concentration: Information Systems Design. Courses taught us how to gather requirements and design systems, work with databases and innovate on existing processes. Good friends that I made there also inspired me to continue programming and web development.</p>

		<p>My first co-op term with an international firm like Baker & McKenzie was eye-opening. As part of the Information Technology/Communications team, I developed a report generating app to solve a workflow bottleneck. The reports detailed cross-jurisdiction analysis for multinational companies looking to implement comprehensive information management policies. Compilation time was reduced to seconds from hours, and allowed for rapid iterations. I also spent some time developing SharePoint portal sites for client-lawyer document collaboration.</p>

		<p>The Global Centre for eHealth Innovation was my second placement, this time with development teams working on healthcare apps. I did a bit of system and process mapping for them, but I learned the most from building the product pages. Those sites taught me about preprocessors (scss), sass, jekyll, liquid, and nodejs.</p>

		<p>Right now, I feel like I’ve built up a solid base and have the energy and drive to keep learning. Things are starting to click that were remote outposts just a few months back. I want to keep learning quickly and work in environments that will help accelerate that growth. Above all, I want to do good work for my clients, and work with people that are inspiring and design better worlds.</p>
