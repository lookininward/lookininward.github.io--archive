I was first exposed to Jekyll about 6 months ago when I started a co-op term with the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation. They wanted me to create a few simple product pages for the healthcare apps they were developing. They had already purchased a template that was built using Foundation and Jekyll, and encouraged me to modify the template as opposed to writing a site from scratch.

Although I was a little skeptical about uses a static site generator at first, it's become clear over the last few months that the tendency to go with high tech solutions just results in a lot of development pain - especially when it comes to use cases like product sites or blogs. I had (have) the tendency to want to try out difficult solutions, but I'm starting to embrace the minimalistic approach where possible. 

This is the first time building out a blog with Jekyll. Check in from time to time to see how things go!

Note: Incase you're wondering, I'm hosting this blog on Github.com with the basic build coming from <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a>.
