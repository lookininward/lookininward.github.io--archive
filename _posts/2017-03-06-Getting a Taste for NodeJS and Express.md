I've been hearing a lot about NodeJS and the benefits of having front and back end written in a single language - JS. To get used to NodeJS and its related technologies I'm working on a modification of <a href="http://www.raybo.org/blog/2016/12/20/You-Should-Build-Your-Next-Website-with-Node-and-ExpressJS.html" target="_blank">Ray V's website template</a>.

The project is fairly simple with the following goals:
- Learn the Embeddable JavaScript (EJS) templating language
- Learn Express for site routing
- Learn NodeJS to run a development server
- Learn how to integrate bootstrap (beyond CDN) into the project
